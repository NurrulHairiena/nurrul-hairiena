Hello, and welcome to Hairiena Space! My name is Nurrul Hairiena Binti Arza, and I'm the owner of this THS (The Hairiena Space). I am 20 years old, and I'm thrilled to share my journey with you. I come from Johor, a beautiful state in Malaysia known for its rich culture and vibrant community. 
<br><br>

Growing up in Johor taught me the importance of family, friendships, and hard work. These values have shaped who I am today.Currently, I'm studying in Kedah, where I am a student of the informatics library, which has been a whole new adventure. Moving to a different state for my studies has given me the opportunity to meet new people, explore different places, and learn more about myself. It's not always easy, but every challenge brings growth, and I'm embracing it all with an open mind and a positive attitude.
<br><br>

I am just an ordinary girl who likes to read a book,take photos, make a vlog, listen to music, and watch movies. I also like to go cafe hunting with my sibling, where we like to try different kinds of desserts and coffee.I will share a little bit of my experience while studying far away from home. I learned to ride new public transport that I had never taken before, such as buses and airplanes. It's not easy since I need to learn all of that by myself, but it's a very fun journey while experiencing all of that. I knew that taking buses really took a long time, so now I choose to ride an aeroplane rather than a bus.

<br><br>
I currently like pastel colours such as yellow and purple, and I gladly put both of these colours on this website, combining them with a little touch of pink. I kind of like to make designs or edit something, so I put all my efforts here in "The Hairiena Space.".
