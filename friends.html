This is my childhood friend, whom I have known since 4 or 5 years old. We grew up together in the same neighbourhood and at the same school, known as SK LKTP Bukit Batu. It was even more special that our parents also knew each other. Their names were Soleha and Fariza. Soleha currently pursues her studies in engineering and is soon to fly to the UK, while Fariza also continues her academics in her course account.We used to be together but have separated since high school, since I moved to a new school. We rarely meet now, but I still love them.

My high school is named Maahad Pontian, and I started my teenage life with all of these people, whom we called "Empire" because we were friends with everyone in our batch. We grew up like siblings since we needed to survive and were independent in hostels.We go through a 5-year journey together, facing many obstacles, and until now, our friendship is still strong even though we are very far away from each other.I love them and am hoping to grow old together.

I never thought that I would be friends with these beautiful people other than my "Empire." We are classmates, but even though we are classmates, the process of becoming too close takes time. We started talking with each other at the end of the year, semester 1, and until now, we have been very close.We are very comfortable with each other, and it's very lively since our circle is so large.

To these people, I will never hesitate to call them my sibling.This is my roommate, which is Izzati, Umairah, and Ummi. I knew them from the first time I entered the Uitm Kedah, and until now, we are still roommates. We never thought we would be a match for each other, and on the first day, we were already close together. Its very hard to find roommates like them now, and I hope for the last semester we are still roommates.
