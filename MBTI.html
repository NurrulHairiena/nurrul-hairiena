Presenting the INFJ-T personality type, one of the most unique and fascinating ones. INFJ-T, or "The Advocate," is a personality type that combines idealism, empathy, and a strong sense of purpose. I live my life with a strong set of morals and a constant commitment to helping others because I'm driven by a deep desire to have a meaningful effect. I welcome you to explore my key characteristics, experiences, and strengths that characterise my path as an INFJ-T, illustrating the ways in which this personality type influences my outlook and goals.

<p class="subtitle">
A unique combination of characteristics defines my INFJ-T personality, all of which influence how I see and engage with the world. Being an introvert (52%), I value meaningful connections over surface-level conversations and turn to silence for comfort and recovery. My intuitive (66%) personality enables me to see past appearances and have a greater understanding of people and circumstances. I prioritise feelings and empathy, placing a high value on feeling (71%), and I base my decisions and actions on how they will affect other people. I have a judging (72%) personality type, which implies I like planning ahead, following a set of rules, and aiming for accomplishment in my activities. 
Lastly, my personality's turbulent side (57%) reveals that I always strive for personal growth and am frequently reflective and sensitive to stress. These characteristics work together to create a personality that is motivated by strong beliefs and a constant desire to have a positive influence on the world.

Strenght & Weakness of INFJ-T
</p>

<div class="container">
        <dl>
            <dt>Insightful</dt>
            <dd>- People with the INFJ personality type (Advocates) know all too well that appearances can be misleading. These personalities strive to move beyond superficiality and seek out the deeper truths in life. This can give them an almost uncanny ability to understand people’s true motivations, feelings, and needs.</dd>
            <dt>Principled</dt>
            <dd>- INFJs tend to have strong beliefs and values, particularly when it comes to matters of ethics. They consider lying to be morally wrong, and they make a concerted effort to not deceive others – even when they could directly benefit from doing so. In fact, they are the least likely personality type to say they sometimes take advantage of other people.</dd>
         
        <dt>Creative</dt>
            <dd>- INFJ personalities aren’t exactly like everyone else – and that’s a wonderful thing. They embrace their creative side, always on the lookout for opportunities to express themselves and think outside the box.</dd>

<br><br><br>

      <dt>Sensitive to crticsm</dt>
            <dd>- INFJs are often averse to criticism, especially if they believe that someone is challenging their most cherished principles or values. When it comes to the issues that are near and dear to them, people with this personality type can become defensive, dismissive, or angry.</dd>

      <dt>Reluctant to open up</dt>
            <dd>- INFJ personalities value honesty and authenticity, but they’re also private. They may find it difficult to open up and be vulnerable about their struggles, not wanting to burden someone else with their issues. Unfortunately, when they don’t ask for help, they may inadvertently hold themselves back or create distance in their relationships.</dd>

Friendship style 
</p>

<p class="subtitle">
I may come out as quiet or restrained to the wider public, but around my close friends, I really come alive. Speaking with a like-minded person about my passions, interests, and views is one of the things that I like and find most fulfilling. Even though I enjoy spending time alone, I feel free to let my guard down and be who I really am when I'm with a buddy I can rely on.
</p>
<br>

<p class="subtitle">
Being an INFJ, I have high standards for both my friendships and myself. Honesty ranks highly on my list of expectations. I'm probably not the best buddy for someone if I have to be fake or soften myself in order to win their trust. Respecting someone who isn't also a real and honest person is difficult for me. My expectations for my friendships also include growth and support from one another. While having fun together is great, I don't think it goes far enough. I want to hang out with folks who push me to grow, learn, and get better. Helping each other fulfil our individual life purposes is, in my opinion, the best way for each of us to become closer.
